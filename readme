Pros
- multiple users
- automated discovery of users' sleep traits
- intelligent suggestions based on users' sleep traits and pools data
- the LLM logic is separate from the Telegram frontend, so it is easy to add new frontends
- messages are scheduled daily, from the next day 12pm till the time of flight - 20 minutes

only meaningful messages (parsing states are skipped) are passed to the LLM memory, so it trakcks only the most important information.

assumption: users won't search other numbers
no duplicate phone number in the pool
